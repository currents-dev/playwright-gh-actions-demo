# Demonstrates a workflow that initially runs the previously failed tests
## Consists of 3 jobs: previousFailedFirst, fullRun, recordFailedTests
#
# GitHub Action Job Details
## previousFailedFirst - downloads previous failures for the branch, if there are any, it runs those failures using a matrix
## * uses action `dawidd6/action-download-artifact` to find the completed run for the current pr source branch. (can be changes to commit/pr/run_id)
##
## fullRun - only runs if there were no failed test, or all failed tests now pass (uses GitHub actions if conditions)
##
## recordFailedTests - merges and saves tests output from the previous jobs if one of them failed
## * produces a summary.json file using an `@butchmayhew/playwright-json-summary-reporter` reporter that includes a failure array.
## * `playwright merge-reports` is used to bring all the reports together (so we have all the failures)
#
# Playwright details
## When running playwright, the `blob` reporter is being used to produce artifacts, this produces report output that can be merged later.
